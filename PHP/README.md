## Local PHP Development Environment(s)

### macOS

* MAMP (Mac - Apache - MySQL - PHP): <https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/>
* XAMPP (x - Apache - MySQL - PHP - Python): <https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html>

### Windows

* XAMPP (x - Apache - MySQL - PHP - Python): <https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html>
* WAMP (Windows - Apache - MySQL -
  PHP): <http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper>
  * several people, include your instructors, had some problems
    getting WAMP installed and running, so we think XAMPP is the
    better way to go on Windows.

## PHP Documentation

The main website for php, <https://www.php.net>, is one of the better
documented systems, because it contains **lots** of extra commentary
from decades of PHP developers' experience. While the language syntax
is fairly small, the libraries that come with PHP are huge. Keep the
site bookmarked and in a browser window while you're developing.

## Books

* [Head-First PHP & MySQL](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006303.do)

  Head First imprint.
