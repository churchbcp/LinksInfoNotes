# Tools: Git, Editors, etc.

## Git

* **Falling In Love With Git** slides: <https://gdiminneapolis.github.io/falling-in-love-with-git> [[github repo](https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git)]
* Many resources given here: <https://github.com/gdiminneapolis/falling-in-love-with-git/blob/master/resources.md>

## Editors

Modern editors
include
[Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Others to try include the IDE's
from [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com),
including
[WebStrorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm),
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/rubymine),
and others.

The old standbys include Vim, nano, and Emacs. Although it's Tamara's
favourite editor, Emacs is probably one no one else needs to spend
time learning.

* [Learn Thou Editor](https://www.mobomo.com/2015/03/learn-thou-editor/)
  No one wants to. It's time-consuming, and can lead one down
  rat-holes of unusual size. Follow the simple suggestion here to
  learn your editor as you go.

* [The Ultimate Atom Editor Setup (for JS/React)](https://medium.com/productivity-freak/my-atom-editor-setup-for-js-react-9726cd69ad20)
  This is a collection of Atom editor packages that help when writing
  JavaScript (and especially React.JS) but also work well with editing
  other sorts of files as well.

* For other things like this, try Googling "Best Atom Packages" or
  "Best Sublime Text Packages".

### Sublime Text

#### Viewing a web page in a browser from Sublime Text

  Anyone else @here use Webstorm? I always forget what the file status colors mean:

## Command Line

Working on the command line is essential for some development, but not
all. Still, it's a pretty useful skill to have since you can do some
things a lot faster by typing some commands than repeatedly moving,
clicking and dragging a mouse.

* [Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
  A good beginning tutorial into using the command line.
