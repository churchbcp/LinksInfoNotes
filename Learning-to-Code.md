Learning to code is a lot more than just learning a programming
language's syntax. Some of these discuss various aspects of the
*other* stuff you need to know.



* [Stuff every programmer should know](https://github.com/mr-mig/every-programmer-should-know/blob/master/README.md)
  "A collection of technical things every software engineer should know."

* [Spellbook of Modern Web Dev](https://github.com/dexteryy/spellbook-of-modern-webdev),
  "A Big Picture, Thesaurus, and Taxonomy of Modern JavaScript Web Development"

  This one covers pretty much all aspects of web development, not just
  JavaScript, which is why it's over here.
