Hello!

Just some heads up for the talks at our meetup next week, this is the order of speakers:

(List of speakers and time alotments)

A card with '5' on it will be held up 5 minutes before the end of your talk, and a '1' one minute before. 
If you go over a minute, I will signal to end it and if that doesn't work I'll stand up next to you. 
(Please don't make me stand up). Please note that the time allotted to you also includes your time for 
audience questions.

If you have any questions or need any particular equipment, please let us know and we'll figure it out. 
The projector is set up for HDMI at the time. If your computer does not support HDMI, please let me
know ahead of time so we can make arrangements. If your presentation can be run from the web, that would
be the best since we could use a different computer if need be.

Please provide links to any slides, pdfs, info, etc., so it can be included in the meeting notes afterwards.

Thank you for speaking and we look forward to your talks!
