We've been using our Slack team channels to share information, links,
and other interesting things during our classes, and to share other
things any time.

We've lost some of these sharings over time because of Slack's
limitation on the number of messages we can have.

So, in the spirit of keeping our lore handy, provide a space for more
collaboration, and general learning, this repository will attempt to
keep that info from floating away.

## Structure

The structure is really pretty simple. Each topic area is matched to a
Slack channel, and the topic area is a directory.

In each directory is the main README.md file, and there can be other
files if the information needs to be broken up somehow. (It's no fun
to try to read through and 80-page README any more than scrolling back
through Slack channels.)
