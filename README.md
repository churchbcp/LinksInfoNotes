## Slack

GDIMpls uses Slack to communicate before, during, and after classes,
and to provide a place for students and members to discuss problems,
ask questions, get advice, and just general chitchat.

## Files

* [Links](Links.md) holds various links given out in class for refernce.

(More coming soon.)

## Contributing

Yes!! YOU TOO CAN ADD TO THIS!!

If you have links you'd like to share, put them into the slack channel `#wordpress-classes` and they'll get added here (eventually, it's a human process).

Also, you can create issues at the link above, say anything you'd like to see added here, or ask questions.

If you're game, you can fork this repo, make the changes you would like, and submit a Pull Request back to us.
